# Introduction
The Loan Calculator is a web-based application built using React that enables users to easily calculate their monthly loan payments (EMI), total repayment amount, and interest payable. Designed with a clean and responsive interface, this tool helps users make informed financial decisions by providing real-time results based on loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure inputs. Leveraging React Hooks for state management and SCSS for styling, the app ensures smooth interactivity and modern design. It also utilizes local storage to retain user inputs for convenience. Ideal for personal or educational use, this project showcases core React concepts in a practical scenario.

# Features

- üî¢ Real-time loan and EMI calculation
- üé® Clean, responsive UI styled using SCSS
- üíæ Saves previous user inputs using LocalStorage
- ‚öõÔ∏è React functional components with hooks
- üß† Input validation for reliable calculations

# Technologies Used

- React (via Create React App)
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- SCSS (`node-sass`)
- LocalStorage API
- HTML5 / CSS3
